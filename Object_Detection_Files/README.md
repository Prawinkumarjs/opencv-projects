## Object Detection with MobileNet SSD

This project demonstrates object detection using the MobileNet Single Shot Detector (SSD) model. The model is implemented using OpenCV and Python.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to detect objects in real-time using a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model. The project includes the following components:

- **Loading the MobileNet SSD model**
- **Capturing video feed**
- **Detecting objects in each frame**
- **Displaying the results**

## Requirements


- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- NumPy
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone
       https://github.com/prawinkumarjs/opencv-projects.git
        cd opencv-projects/Object_Detection_Files

3. Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Run the following command to start object detection on your webcam feed:

    python object_detection.py
